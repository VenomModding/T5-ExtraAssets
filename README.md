# T5-ExtraAssets
Extra Assets for the Black Ops Mod Tools that have some assets fixed up from other CoD titles.

# The Purpose of the Pack
This pack is full of optional stuff to add upon the lacking Black Ops Mod Tools. Accompanied by utilizing [T5-MissingAssets](https://github.com/VenomModding/T5-MissingAssets) as a base, [LinkerMod](https://github.com/Nukem9/LinkerMod) or [LinkerMod Enhanced](https://github.com/ribbitpoison/LinkerMod-Enhanced), this pack can pack a serious punch for everyone to use the additional assets for their Mod Tools Experience, so people don't have to do extra ports anymore. This is all done by professionals.

# Installation (Manual)
Download the [source code ZIP file on this page](https://github.com/VenomModding/T5-ExtraAssets). Then, you insert every file to your main Black Ops Directory.
