# T5-MissingAssets
Extra Assets for the Black Ops Mod Tools, some assets have been fixed up from other CoD titles.

# The Purpose of the Pack
This pack is made to complete everything that the Black Ops Mod Tools has lacked. Accompanied by utilizing [T5-MissingAssets](https://github.com/VenomModding/T5-MissingAssets), [LinkerMod](https://github.com/Nukem9/LinkerMod) or [LinkerMod Enhanced](https://github.com/ribbitpoison/LinkerMod-Enhanced), this pack can pack a serious punch for everyone to use the complete assets, as they were intended with the original Mod Tools.

# Installation (Manual)
Download the [source code ZIP file on this page](https://github.com/VenomModding/T5-ExtraAssets). Then, you insert every file to your main Black Ops Directory.
