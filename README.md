# T5 Extra Assets
Extra Assets for the Black Ops Mod Tools that have some assets fixed up from other CoD titles.

# The Purpose of the Pack
This pack is full of optional stuff to add upon the lacking Black Ops Mod Tools. Accompanied by utilizing [T5-MissingAssets](https://github.com/VenomModding/T5-MissingAssets) as a base, [LinkerMod](https://github.com/Nukem9/LinkerMod) or [LinkerMod Enhanced](https://github.com/ribbitpoison/LinkerMod-Enhanced), this pack can pack a serious punch for everyone to use the additional assets for their Mod Tools Experience, so people don't have to do extra ports anymore. This is all done by professionals.

# Installation (Manual)
Download the [source code ZIP file on this page](https://github.com/VenomModding/T5-ExtraAssets). Then, you insert every file to your main Black Ops Directory.

# Compiling to Mod Tools
We suggest running the GDTs one by one using Asset Manager. 
However, if you don't mind, you can also use the Converter. Not recommended though.

# Issues
- Electric Cherry, Who's Who is still a WIP. Prefabs are done and complete, however, the scripts are still not done/complete.
- T7 textures are not in a GDT, those are up to the end user to make brand new GDTs and do a pull request if they wish. If there is an exisiting BO3 GDT, it is not compatible with the current Legacy Asset Manager.
- Most assets aren't going to be compiled, and to not get a C&D. We will not provide GDTs as its up to the end user to complete and compile the assets on their own.

# Contribution
If you want to contribute to the T5-ExtraAssets pack, we would appreciate you doing a pull request. We're always glad to see people helping out.
